# ðŸ§  Predicting Mental Health Using NLP

This project uses machine learning and NLP to analyze social media text and predict mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The model uses data from Reddit and Twitter posts, with a pipeline that includes text cleaning, feature extraction (TF-IDF, GloVe, BERT), and classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. It aims to support mental health analysis and research through early detection of emotional distress patterns in online behavior.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python, NLTK, scikit-learn
- BERT (Transformers), Word2Vec
- Twitter API, Pandas, Matplotlib

## ðŸ’¡ Model Highlights

- Preprocessing with tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal
- Feature engineering using TF-IDF and embeddings
- Trained on 5 classifiers with hyperparameter tuning
- Achieved F1-score of **0.82**

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone repo  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Load data â†’ Preprocess â†’ Train models  
4. Test predictions on unseen tweets or Reddit comments

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact

Helps in early risk identification in social media behavior with potential applications in telehealth and crisis intervention.
